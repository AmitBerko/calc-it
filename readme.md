## Usage

1. **Creating a New Level:** Visit the website [calcit.pro](https://calcit.pro) to access the Calculator Editor. You will see an empty calculator interface on the main page. Note: Please be aware that creating new levels is only supported on desktop and larger screen devices. On mobile phones, you can only play existing levels.

2. **Editing Level Settings:** On the right side of the screen you will find a section where you can change the settings. Simply insert your input and click on the "Update Settings" button.

3. **Adding Buttons:** To add buttons to the calculator, click on an empty button space, this will make a new button menu appear with a variety of buttons to choose from. Click on the desired button and it will be added to the calculator.

4. **Handling Input Buttons:** Some buttons require input values. When you click on these buttons, instead of immediately adding them to the calculator, a new input section will open. Insert the required input and click on the same button again to add it with the input value.

5. **Removing Buttons:** If you want to remove a button, simply right-click on it. This will remove the selected button from the calculator.

6. **Saving the Level:** Once you've finished creating the level, click on the "Save Level" button. This will generate a unique link that you can share with others. When the link is accessed, it will open the specific level you created in the Calculator Editor.

## Button Descriptions

1. **Number Buttons:** Clicking on a number button adds the corresponding number to the calculator's input. For instance, if the result is 123, clicking the number button "4" will change it to 1234.

2. **Operation Buttons:** Operation buttons include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท). Clicking on an operation button performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on the current result using the input value.

3. **Clear Button:** Clicking the clear button (CLR) resets the calculator, clearing the current result.

4. **Special Buttons:** Special buttons introduce unique functionalities and additional gameplay mechanics to your levels. Here are the descriptions of the available special buttons:

   - **Sum Button:** The sum button calculates the sum of the digits in the current result.

   - **Mirror Button:** When pressed, the mirror button adds a reversed version of the current result to itself. For example, if the result is 123, clicking the mirror button will change it to 123321.

   - **Power Button:** The power button raises the current result to a specified power.

   - **Delete Button:** The delete button removes the last digit from the current result.

   - **Plus/Minus Button:** This button changes the sign of the current result.
